# Preregistered analysis

The preregistered model for fitting the data from the fifth experiment of the PhD. 
We test the hypothesis that thinking about a set of stimuli in terms of an order, rather than similarity relations,
causes a preference for monotone categories.

Files:
- README.pdf contains a detailed description of the model and the hypothesis testing.
- model_fitting.ipynb contains the code instantiating the model in the library PyMC3.
